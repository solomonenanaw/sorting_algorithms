0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O


Description


What you should learn from this project:

At least four different sorting algorithms

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input

What is a stable sorting algorithm

1. Insertion sort

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

2. Selection sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

3. Quick sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
